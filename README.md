## Some Important Points

i. In the "server" folder, you'll find a .env file. This file contains compassionate information, including API keys for OpenAI and AssemblyAI. Treat this file with utmost care and avoid sharing it openly.

ii. To authenticate with the Google API, there is a file in the "server" folder named "tmpyashwant.json." This file is also susceptible, as it is used for authentication with Google's servers. The file is automatically imported into the project's environmental variables, and Google uses it to authenticate every request.
